<p><strong>Vision:</strong><br>
One difficult task when it comes to writing for an audience is coming up with the meta details &amp; labels, i.e. title, cover image, genre, etc…  This project exists to ease some of that burden by suggesting options for genre classification to authors, editors, publishers, or whomever is making these decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Mission:</strong><br>
Give suggestions for meta data about a piece of writing, specifically genre, based on a user’s input (a summary of the larger prose piece).</p>
<p><strong>Success Criteria:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Model Performance: Genre classification accuracy of &gt;= 75%</li>
<li>Business Performance:  User considers genre suggestion to be helpful &gt;= 50% of the time.</li>
</ul>
